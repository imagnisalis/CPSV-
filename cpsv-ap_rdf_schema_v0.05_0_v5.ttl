  dct:description "The original CPSV-AP was prepared in the context of Action 1.3 – Accessing Member State information resources at European level – Catalogue of Services  of the European Commission’s Interoperability for European Public Administrations (ISA) programme. The CPSV-AP has been seen as a first step for creating a model for describing public services related to business events, to facilitate the set-up of catalogues of services in the context of the Services Directive. New version 2.0 was developed with three primary aims: To add the concept of life events in order to broaden the scope of the CPSV-AP to describe any type of public services for any type of eGovernment portal; To implement any other change requests, identified by users of the CPSV and CPSV-AP; and to define initial taxonomies that can be used as controlled vocabularies for CPSV-AP, for public service outputs, second level business events and life events."@en ;
